# Design

We use this folder to track the design work and credit the people involved. The mockups are made in Figma, we export a .fig file and save it in the repository for further use upon transfering the project.

To update, make sure to pull the remote commits first, then override the current file with the new version of the design.

The cloud version hosted on figma.com is the most reliable source of truth, in case you work on different figma projects, it won't be synchronized.
You should then make sure to only overide the layer you worked on in order to prevent deletion of the work of others on the archive version.
You can do that by importing the Figma project in this repository in your own project and resolve conflicts in Figma before pushing your changes.
